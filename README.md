GBA_MiyooV4_overlay.7z:
-----------------------
A pack of pixel-perfect GBA overlays that 100% match the Miyoo Mini V4's screen, to be used when running any Retroarch GBA emulator in it.

1 - Unpack/uncompress the 7z file's contents (the PNG files as well as the CFG files) into the SD card's folder: \\RetroArch\.retroarch\overlay\GBA

2 - While running any GBA game, bring up the Retroarch's Quick Menu (default "Menu Button" + "Select")

3 - Navigate down the Quick Menu and press A to open the "On-Screen Overlay" menu.

4 - Enable "Display Overlay" (if it is not already ON) by pressing A

5 - Go down to and press A to select "Overlay Preset", this will bring up the folder explorer to find the overlay you want to use

6 - Navigate to the folder where the png and cfg files were placed and choose whichever overlay you want (pressing A to select or B to go back)

7 - After selecting the overlay that you want to use, you will be back to the "On-Screen Display" menu from Step 3

8 - Press B once to go back to the Quick Menu from Step 2

9a - If you just want to go back and check out the game with that overlay, go up to and select "Resume" by pressing A

9b - If/when you want to set that overlay as default for any other GBA game:

    in the Quick Menu go down to and enter "Overrides" using A,
    
    in the Overrides menu go down to "Save Content Directory Overrides" and press A to save,
    
    then go back to and do steps 8 and 9a, to go back to the game.

GB_MiyooV4_pixelperfect.7z:
---------------------------
This is a single overlay for playing Gameboy / Gameboy Color games on Miyoo Mini V4's screen.
The Miyoo Mini V4's screen does not really support good integer scaling of GB / GBA games, but this overlay is made in such a way as to mask out the imnperfections (hide them behind the dark borders) while leaving the actual intended pixels visible.
So it is possibly the closest that the Miyoo V4's screen can get to "pixel perfect gb / gbc".
Similar setup and usage instructions to the pack above.

Enjoy!
